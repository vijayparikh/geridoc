As healthcare professionals, we take care of many patients who along with their
families, their stories, and their courage, touch our lives. My journey as a physician has
been a humbling and enriching experience. I am thankful for the opportunity I have been
provided to help others and have would like to use this platform to share my views and
bring awareness of issues that are important. My aim is to touch on a variety of medical
topics to educate myself and others. This site is not intended to provide personalized
medical advice.
