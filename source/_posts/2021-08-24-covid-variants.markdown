With COVID cases increasing in the United States and elsewhere, schools opening, debate of masking or not masking, a multitude of hospitals reporting beds at full capacity, it is evident that the pandemic is far from over. We have a multitude of new variants of coronavirus now and what appears to be a long fall and winter ahead of us.

##What are variants?
- Variants occur due to one or more mutations of the original virus and are better at escaping the immune response lodged by our bodies.
- Some variants of concern:
  - Alpha -B.1.1.7-first identified in United Kingdom
  - Beta -B.1.351-first identified in South Africa
  - Gamma -P.1-first identified in Japan/Brazil
  - Delta -B.1.617.2-first identified in India
  - Lambda -C.37-first identified in Peru, has not been labeled as a variant of concern by CDC but has been by WHO, it is being watched now as it is spreading rapidly in South America

##Why are we concerned about the delta variant?
- The delta variant accounts for over 93% of all new COVID cases and has caused a rapid spread in multiple states.
- It is highly contagious and therefore spreads quickly-it is as contagious as chicken pox and twice as contagious as the original COVID-19 virus
- It affects unvaccinated people more
- Younger people seem to be getting affected more with more hospitalization rates but it is unclear if this is related to less vaccination rates
- In vaccinated people, it has been shown to cause breakthrough cases

##What are the symptoms of Delta variant?
- cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, loss of smell
- Gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are less common with the delta variant
- For those vaccinated, they could be mild symptoms and you are less likely to require hospitalization but recent studies show you may have a high viral load so could pass it on to others

##What can we do?
- We can do the stuff that we know works
- Take the vaccine if you have not
- Mask up
- Social distancing when appropriate
- Keep up with the hand hygiene
