There has been a lot of hype about the Mediterranean Diet especially since it's been found in studies to have lots of health benefits. It was found in the 1950s that heart disease was not as common in Mediterranean countries(countries around the Mediterranean sea) as it was in the U.S which prompted many studies which confirmed that Mediterranean Diet helps prevent heart disease and stroke.

The Mediterranean Diet emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats. The diet mostly consists of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains with olive oil being the main source of fat. Olive oil provides monounsaturated fat which lowers total cholesterol and LDL(bad cholesterol). Eating patterns are different across different Mediterranean countries so it is flexible and should be tailored per individual taste.

####Guidelines of Mediterranean Diet
