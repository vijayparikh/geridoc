Blue zones are a term used by author Dan Buettner who has studied areas with long longevity for the past 2 decades. Blue zones are regions of the world where people live longer and healthier lives than average(about a decade longer than the US or Western Europe).

Here are some of the things that individuals in these blue zones are doing:

###Okinawa, Japan
- world's longest lived women
- diet plant-based with [antioxidants](https://geridoc.net/blog/2022/12/01/antioxidants-and-oxidative-stress/) and nutrient-rich vegetables and leaves
- stop eating when they are 80% full and practice [mindful eating](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/03/13/practice-intentional-eating/)(average calorie intake is 1900 compared to US average of 3600 calories)
- they practice "ikigai" -they have a reason for living and life purpose such as gardening, art, friends
- gardening is a part of life-get activity in, have fresh produce, and move around
- traditionally sit on the floor to eat and relax-this means the elderly are getting up and down off the floor several times a day which helps with buliding lower body strength and balance

###Sardonia, Italy
- highest male centenarians in the world(in the US, 100 year old women outnumber men by 6:1 but in Sardinia, the ratio is 1:1)
- steep towns built on the hillside make mobility and exercise a daily part of life by just [walking](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/07/30/what-can-walking-30-minutes-a-day-do/)
- eat primarily plant-based diet and also consume  Cannonau wine which has the highest amount of polyphenols in the world

###Ikaria, Greece
- Island with almost no dementia
- villages are steep so everywhere they go and walk, they get exercise in
- follow a [Mediterranean diet](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/06/18/mediterranean-diet-explained/) with lots of vegetables and fruit

###Nicoya, Costa Rica
- splitting logs helps elder stay mobile
-walk regularly
- Meso-american diet-corn, beans, squash
- spend 1/5th amount on healthcare than the US does

###Loma Linda, California
- live an average of 10 years more than average Americans
- eat healthy whole foods like nuts, vegetables and beans which is a diet per the faith they practice as this community has the highest concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. Adventists also do not smoke or drink alcohol.

###Singapore
- In addition, Mr. Buettner has proposed Singapore as a new blue zone.
- now has the longest, healthiest life expectancy in the world
- promote healthy food-junk food is taxed, healthy food is subsidized
- promote mobility-driving is taxed, walking is subsidized
- if your aging parent lives within 500 yards of you, you get a tax break(which helps older people get the care they need in times of need)
- National Steps Challenge encourages residents to move more and incentivizes by letting them redeem points to use to shop or eat at restaurants.  

So, what is the secret to a long, healthy life? It's not a vigorous exercise routine or supplements.
It comes down to eating good food, getting a good night's sleep, having good friends, and moving around naturally throughout the day.

###Here are some of the what stands out in all of the blue zones:
- Eating good food: Cook yourself! Don't order out. Focus on a plant-based diet-simple foods containing whole grains, vegetables, greens, beans, and tubers, such as sweet potatoes. Use herbs. Eating a cup of beans a day not only gets you protein and fiber, but associated with living an extra 4 years. Don't overeat.
- Don't shy away from social interactions
- Move around-you don't have to necessarily go to the gym, any activity is helpful...gardening, walking
- Get a good night's sleep
