Per *Solycyre Burga* in [Time.com](https://time.com/6958494/united-states-falls-world-happiness-report/) *"U.S. Falls Out of Top 20 Happiest Countries for the First Time Ever".*

>
"For the first time in the World Happiness Report’s dozen-year history, the U.S. did not rank in the top 20 of the world’s happiest countries.
>
Out of the more than 140 nations surveyed, the U.S. landed in 23rd place, compared to 15th place in 2023. While the U.S. is still in the top 10 happiest countries for those 60 years old and above, its overall ranking fell due to a significant decline in the reported well-being of Americans under 30.
>
Finland ranked at the top of the list for the seventh year in a row. Lithuania is the happiest country in the world if you only look at those under the age of 30, while Denmark is the happiest country for people who are 60 and older........
>
According to the report, people born before 1965 are, on average, happier than people born after 1980. Millennials report drops in their life satisfaction with every year they grow older, while boomers’ happiness increases the older they get."

The [2024 World Happiness report](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/349487/gallup-global-happiness-center.aspx#:~:text=and%20national%20scale.-,The%202024%20edition%20focuses%20on%20the%20happiness,at%20different%20stages%20of%20life.&text=At%20the%20global%20level%2C%20averaged,over%20the%20past%20dozen%20years.&text=Among%20those%20born%20after%201980,with%20each%20year%20of%20age.) was released by Gallup and its partners on March 20, 2024 and looked at 3 year average from 2021 to 2023. The U.S ranked 62nd just at looking at the happiness of people under the age of 30 and came in 10th when looking at people over the age of 60. A lot can be said for Finland who has maintained the top spot for the last 7 years. Maybe other nations should learn from them.
