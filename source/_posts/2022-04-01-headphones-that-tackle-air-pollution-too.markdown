This is a really innovative product Dyson has come up to tackle what many cities are facing-pollution! It is estimated that 9 out of 10 people live in urban areas worldwide and are affected by air pollution. Air pollution causes oxidative stress and inflammation in human cells which may lead to chronic diseases and cancer. In fact, air pollution has been classified as a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization. It is said to increase the risk for emphysema more than smoking one pack of cigarettes a day. It can affect every organ of the body and exacerbate existing health conditions.
Reducing air pollution involves everbody doing their part. Some things that can be done include:

- Buy a lower-polluting (zero emission) car if making a new purchase
- Drive less
- Energy conservation-turn off lights when not using them, replace light bulbs with energy friendly ones, use the fan instead of the air conditioning when feasible
- Recylcle
- Avoid outdoor walks and exercise during high pollution days, instead opt for indoor activity
