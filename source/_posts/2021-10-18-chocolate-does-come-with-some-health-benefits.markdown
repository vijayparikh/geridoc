Who doesn’t love chocolate?  We all have our favorites, be it milk, dark, white chocolate, or another. Most of us are also careful about our chocolate intake due to worries of the calories and sugar that come along with the chocolate bliss.

Mild chocolate and white chocolate have more calcium and protein because of more milk powder content but may also have more sugar. Luckily, chocolate, particularly dark, also comes with some health benefits.

- Contain antioxidants-the darker the chocolate, the higher the concentration of cocoa and higher the level of antioxidants
- Contain flavonoids which help stimulate blood flow
  - Increased blood circulation to scalp results in thicker hair
- Natural source of magnesium (mineral essential for brain health)
  - Can help with concentration and alertness
  - Helps with pituitary gland function, lowers cortisol production, relieving stress and also stimulates serotonin production which makes you feel happy
- Contains phenolics, an antioxidant that boosts the immune system
- [Can reduce bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL) and improved good cholesterol (HDL)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18356327/)


National Chocolate Day is on October 28th so don’t forget to enjoy a piece and don’t feel too guilty about it! Yes, it does has sugar and calories, but smart choices can be made, for example chocolate with nuts. Like everything else…moderation.
