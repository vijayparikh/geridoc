The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion released this video for the 2015 Healthy Aging Summit. This captures the essence of what healthy aging is. It may mean different things to different people but we all strive for a long, healthy, happy, and productive life. For us to reach that goal, we have to work on it. Preventive health screening and treatment, healthy eating, exercise, [stimulating your brain](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/07/30/keep-your-mind-sharp/), and socialization have been shown to promote healthy aging.

September marks Healthy Aging Month which is a good time to look at what we can do to get there. Think of what you can change today to be healthier tomorrow.
