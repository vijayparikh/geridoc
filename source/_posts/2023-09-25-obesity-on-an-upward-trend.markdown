Per *Deidre McPhillips,* in [CNN health](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/21/health/obesity-more-common-states-cdc-data/index.html), *"Obesity is becoming more common in a growing number of states, CDC data show".*

"Obesity is becoming more common in a growing number of states, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, 22 states had at least 35% of adults with obesity, up from 19 states in 2021. Ten years ago, CDC said, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%.

Obesity rates were lowest among young adults, with about 1 in 5 people ages 18 to 24 considered to have obesity. Rates were about twice as high among adults 45 to 54, with a prevalence of about 2 in 5, according to the CDC data. Obesity prevalence also decreased as level of education increased."

As a country, we are headed in the wrong direction.  Obesity is linked to chronic diseases such has hypertension, [heart disease](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/02/25/prioritize-a-heart-healthy-lifestyle/), stroke, osteoarthritis, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, etc. It is interesting that obesity prevelance decreased as education level increased which could mean health literacy is something we could work on to bring awareness to more people. It may not be easy to [lose that extra fat](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/05/19/losing-that-extra-fat-will-take-some-time/), but persistence with [eating healthy](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/03/13/practice-intentional-eating/), building in an [exercise routine](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/06/03/changes-to-expect-wtih-regular-exercise/), and [self care](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/08/19/prioritize-your-wellness-and-selfcare/) will make a difference.
