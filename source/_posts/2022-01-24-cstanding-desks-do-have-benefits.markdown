It can be hard to get that well needed activity our bodies require with long working hours. More and more people are getting standing desks, whether it be an add on to the work place or an adjustable sitting to standing desk. Standing desks provide health benefits that not many know about.

###How long should you stand at a standing desk?
It is best to alternate between sitting and standing about every 30-60 minutes. Research shows that for every one to two hours sitting, it is ideal to spend about one hour standing.

###Some of the benefits of standing desks
- Improves posture, helps in lower back and neck pain
- Helps keep your muscles and joints moving
- Burns calories-men burn about an extra 0.2 calories per minute by standing and women an extra 0.1 calories per minute while standing as compared to sitting
- Improves mood and energy levels
- Improves mental focus and therefore work productivity
- Can improve longevity by preventing [sitting disease](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/04/20/is-sitting-really-bad-for-me/) and all the bad outcomes associated with being sedentary. Standing has been linked to lower rates of heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes

###What are the drawbacks of standing desks?
Standing desks can cause some leg and foot pain(because you are standing for longer periods of time), but some comfy shoes and/or a memory foam/antifatigue mat to stand on will help.


It may be nice to start pondering if that standing desk is something that would work for you, but the main take home point is to make it a point to take every opportunity you can to get up and stand or walk around to prevent sedentary behavior.
