We know some foods are healthier than others such as a nice leafy [salad](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/05/09/ill-have-that-salad/) in comparison to a burger. There are healthy foods that are know as "superfoods" which provide us with a bit of an edge when consumed regularly. A superfood is usually a natural food which is low in calories and nutrient-dense.

###Benefits of superfoods
- Promotes a strong immune system
