Movember or No-Shave November was initially started by Australians combining the terms  "moustache" and "November" together. Movember is when men around the world grow a moustache in the month of November to bring awareness to men's health issues such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health, etc.

On an average, women live about 6 years longer than men, making it important for men to make their health a priority and for women to support this.
