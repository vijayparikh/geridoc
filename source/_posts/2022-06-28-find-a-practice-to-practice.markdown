A summary of the lessons discussed by Emily Saul:

Lesson #5 - Let obstacles become opportunities, challenges are opportunities to learn

Lesson #4 - Not doing something perfectly successful does not mean you are failing, every little step is part of the bigger goal

Lesson #3 - Motivation is directly related to meaning, frame your challenge around something that has purpose in your life

Lesson #2 - If you want to keep doing something, make it regular and give it structure. And if  you want to keep enjoying something, make it unusual and give it variety

Lesson #1 - If there is something that inspires you and has has meaning to you, find the version that works for you and then practice being good at it day after day

Find your practice(noun) and practice(verb) it!
