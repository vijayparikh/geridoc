We often don't think about the nutrition we are getting when we eat something. Part of [intentional eating](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/03/13/practice-intentional-eating/) is putting thought into your meals to get the most nutritional punch while also savoring your meals. When it comes to pears, there are so many ways to incorporate this juicy sweet fruit into your diet.....eat them sliced raw, in salads, baked in pies, in smoothies or cocktails, roasted/grilled with your veggies.....or something else.
