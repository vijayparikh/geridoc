Per *Kristen Fischer,* in [Health](https://www.health.com/climbing-stairs-daily-heart-disease-risk-8357393), *"Climbing Just 50 Stairs a Day Can Help Reduce Heart Disease Risk".*

"If you’re paying attention to how many steps you take a day, you may want to make sure about 50 of them are on a set of stairs.
>
Climbing at least five flights of stairs a day—which equates to about 50 stairs—may slash your risk for cardiovascular disease by about 20%, according to a new [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2023.117300) published in the journal Atherosclerosis.
>
The research shows that regular, heart-healthy exercise does not have to be expensive or time-consuming—and that something as simple and publicly available as a set of stairs can have a large impact on health."

 Setting a goal to live a [heart healthy lifestyle](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/02/25/prioritize-a-heart-healthy-lifestyle/) can often be difficult but small changes can make an impact. There are many [benefits of taking the stairs](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/09/02/why-should-i-take-the-stairs/) and as little as 5 flights of stairs can make a difference. Don't shy away from taking the stairs when you are at work, out and about, or even just at home.
