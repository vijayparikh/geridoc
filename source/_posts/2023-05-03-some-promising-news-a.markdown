A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743522003590#bb0130) published in the journal *Preventive Medicine* looked at 13,000 US adults aged 50 years and older who self-reported sense of purpose and looked at 8 year mortality risk beginning between 2006 to 2008. It was found that having a higher purpose was associated with lower all-cause mortality. The benefit was evident across gender, race, and ethnicity but was felt to be stronger for women as compared to men.

It has also been found that a sense of purpose in life helps in learning and growth and has been linked to less memory impairment and less functional decline.
