James Clear from [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3z40Iks):

>*"Can one tiny change transform your life?  Itâ€™s unlikely you would say so.  But what if you made another?  And another?  And another?  At some point, you will have to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.  The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them"*
<br><br>
>*"Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy."*
<br><br>
####September marks Self Improvement Month and therefore is a great time to reflect on what we can do to break some of those not so good habits and create better habits.
