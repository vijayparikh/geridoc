With it being so cold out there, it is important to not stay out for longer than you safely should to prevent hypothermia and/or frostbite.

You should be looking at the temperature as well as the wind chill factor before leaving for outdoor activities. If the temperature is 26°F and wind chill is 15°F, that means exposed skin will freeze as if it is 15°F outside.

- If wind chill is above 32°F, it is safe to be outside
- If wind chill is between 13-31°F, you can be outside for about 20-30 minutes, but then need to have indoor breaks
- For wind chill less than 13°F, all outdoor activities should be moved indoors as there is a high risk of frostbite

Of note: infants, toddlers, and the elderly are more susceptible to the cold so need to be more careful. When going out in the cold, make sure to [dress in layers](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/11/28/layering-of-clothes-will-keep-you-warm/) and don't forget socks, gloves, hats, and scarves along with your winter coat!
