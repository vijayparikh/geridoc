Per *Lauren Edmonds* in [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/american-millennials-would-take-pay-cut-better-work-life-balance-2024-2) *"American hustle culture is dying. Millennials are willing to take a 20% pay cut for a better work-life balance.".*

"American millennials are over hustle culture.
>
Ford's 2024 trends survey, which conducted 16,086 online interviews in 16 countries, found that millennials in the United States were ready to step back from their desks.
>
About 60% of surveyed American millennials said they would take a 20% pay cut "to achieve a lifestyle that prioritizes my quality of life," which is 5% more than the global average.
>
US millennials were the most willing among their generational cohorts. Just 33% of Baby Boomers were willing to take that salary cut, while 43% of Gen X and 56% of Gen Z agreed."

This [survey](https://corporate.ford.com/microsites/ford-trends-2024/working-for-balance.html) shows that US millennials have gotten something right. The United States is the most overworked developed nation and we need to start looking at achieving a better work-life balance.
