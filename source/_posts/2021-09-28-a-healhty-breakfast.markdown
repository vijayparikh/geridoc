We have all heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Although most people agree that breakfast is important, about a quarter of people tend to skip breakfast, be it time constraint, not feeling hungry, or taking part in a diet or fasting routine.

Breakfast is the meal that breaks the fast after a night of sleep. Our bodies have been deprived of calories, bodily functions have slowed, and metabolism has also slowed down. By having breakfast, the body gets fueled with calories to give it energy and it also kickstarts metabolism to start the day.

Here are some benefits of having breakfast:

###Boost in brain function
- Studies show it improves alertness, concentration, problem-solving ability, and memory. It Improves focus in both work and school. Students who have breakfast tend to get better grades.

###Manages weight
- Breakfast kickstarts your metabolism, helping you [burn calories](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/105/3/e211/5740411?redirectedFrom=fulltext) throughout the day.
- Having breakfast also keeps your appetite in check.
