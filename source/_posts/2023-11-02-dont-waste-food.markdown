Per *Katie Camero,* in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/31/how-to-stop-wasting-food/), *"Why it’s better for your health to stop wasting food".*

"Soon we’ll be heading into the eating season, stuffing ourselves with holiday fare. But how much of it will end up in the garbage?
>
Plenty, say food waste experts. Over a third of all food in the United States goes uneaten. Much of that is commercial food waste — crops left in fields and foods spoiled in transport or tossed by retailers. But about 40 percent of food waste happens in the home, according to Feeding America, a nonprofit working to end hunger in the United States.

The problem is much of the food we waste is healthy food — fruits, vegetables and proteins that we let spoil. Wasting food increases the odds that you’ll reach for packaged and ultraprocessed food that is less healthful.

And while it’s counterintuitive, studies have shown that people waste more food during difficult financial times. The reason: People buy in bulk to save money, only to end up tossing a lot of spoiled food. The average family of four spends $1,500 annually on wasted food, according to the Environmental Protection Agency."

We all have to be thankful of the food we have and prevent food wastage.

- Don't take more than you plan to eat on your plate
- Check out what you already have in your pantry, refrigerator, and freezer before heading out to get groceries
- Try to [organize](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/09/28/benefits-of-cleaning-and-organization/) your pantry and refrigerator so it is not overcrowded and you can see what you have so it gets consumed before it spoils
- Buy only what you need for your meals for the week to prevent fresh fruits and vegetables from spoiling
- Remember to check expiration dates on food items before purchasing
- Use your leftovers-you can repurpose by making something new like sandwiches/soups, or can freeze your leftovers to use on a rainy day
