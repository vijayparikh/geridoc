As per the famous Chinese proverb:
>
“If you want happiness for an hour — take a nap.
>
If you want happiness for a day — go fishing.
>
If you want happiness for a year — inherit a fortune.
>
If you want happiness for a lifetime — help someone else.”

August 28th is National Thoughtful Day. It is a day to check in with yourself and see what you have been doing to spread [thoughtfulness](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/08/26/thoughtfulness-and-your-health/) and joy to others and in the process to yourself as well.
