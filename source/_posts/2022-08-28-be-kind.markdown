Some things to keep in mind on National Thoughtful Day on August 28th and to follow all year round:

- Be kind to others
- Be considerate about others around you
- Help others if you are in a position to help
- Put yourselves in others shoes before reacting or saying something not so nice. Remember words can hurt.
- Be on time if you have a meeting/commitment/event. Everyone's time is just as valuable as yours.
- Smile
- Be polite


Being thoughtful has many [health benefits](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/08/26/thoughtfulness-and-your-health/) and your thoughtfulness will not only brighten up someone else's day but also yours.

####*"The simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.‚Äù -Mahatma Gandhi.*
