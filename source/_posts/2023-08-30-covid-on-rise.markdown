Per *Julie Bosman* in an article published in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/us/covid-cases-hospitalizations.html), *"Not Over Yet: Late-Summer Covid Wave Brings Warning of More to Come".*

"A late-summer wave of coronavirus infections has touched schools, workplaces and local government, as experts warn the public to brace for even more Covid-19 spread this fall and winter.
Hospitalizations have increased 24 percent in a two-week period ending Aug. 12, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In communities across the United States, outbreaks have occurred in recent weeks at preschools, summer camps and office buildings.

But for Americans who have become accustomed to feeling that the nation has moved beyond Covid, the current wave could be a rude reminder that the emerging New Normal is not a world without the virus.


<br><br>
COVID cases and hospitalizations continue to increase over the past 6 weeks. Although, many thought COVID is gone, this is a reminder that COVID is here to stay and we need to continue to act responsibly. If you are sick and test postive, you should quarantine to prevent spreading to others. As COVID cases continue to rise, it is yet to be seen if it will take a further toll on the healthcare system/healthcare workers, and what, if any, restrictions may come back.
