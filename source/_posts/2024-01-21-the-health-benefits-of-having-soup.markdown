It's cold and chilly out there, and what better than enjoying a nice steamy bowl of soup during the winter months. Soup can be used as starter or even as a main meal. It is prepared in a way that preserves nutritional value so you are getting in a good amount of vitamins, minerals, and proteins.  

###Benefits of soups:
- A good way to get in your veggies-you can just about place any type of vegetable in, fresh or frozen
- Easy to prepare especially if using the instant pot or a slow cooker
- Provides good hydration and a feeling of satiety
- A good way to maintain or even lose weight-a bowl of soup can make you feel full and cut back on eating a bigger meal with it or eating junk food
- High in protein and fiber-allows you to add in vegetables, legumes, and grains
- Leftovers can be frozen and enjoyed later
- Helps your immunity-soups are loaded with nutrients such as garlic, onions, carrots, celery, that have been shown to fight off infections
- The hot liquid of soup can help soothe a sore throat when sick
- Helps practice [mindful eating](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/03/13/practice-intentional-eating/) as you sip soup slowly, allowing you to savor the contents

###What to watch out for:
- Be careful of things that can increase the calorie and sodium content of your soup such as condiments, thickening agents(such as heavy cream, cheese), and instant or canned soups(have high sodium content)
- use salt in moderation, add in other flavoring agents such as garlic, basil, oregano, onion powder, etc to get that flavor
