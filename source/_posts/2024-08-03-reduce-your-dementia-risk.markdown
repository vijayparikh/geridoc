Per *Philippa Roxby & Elena Bailey,* in [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c84jdxd4x1ro) *"Two new dementia risks identified by major report".*

>
"Treating failing eyesight and high cholesterol are two new ways to lower the risk of dementia developing, a major report suggests.
>
Scientists have now identified 14 health issues which, if reduced or eliminated, could theoretically prevent nearly half of dementias in the world.
>
Most of the reason why we get dementia is down to things we cannot control, such as the genes we inherit from our parents and grandparents.
>
But 45% of our risk can be changed, according to international experts in the field, and can therefore be reduced."

[The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care](https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care) published a report on July 31, 2024 with recommendations to reduce dementia risk in the world. While we canâ€™t change our genes, we can definitely work on reducing our other risk factors.
