There have been two recent studies that have come out that have concluded improved longevity for those who have diets with higher amounts of Omega 3 fatty acids.

###What are Omega 3 Fatty acids?
- They are essential fatty acids that you can only get from your diet.
- The body uses omega-3 fatty acids to maintain cell function as well as an  energy source.
- There are 3 main types
  - ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) plant based source
  - DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) animal source
  - EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) animal source

###Health benefits
- Reduced risk of inflammatory diseases
- Helps with depression and anxiety symptoms
- Good for eye health
- Reduces risk of cardiovascular disease
- Helps with arthritis and reduces joint pain
- Supports development of fetal brain during pregnancy and reduces incidence of preterm labor
- Reduces premature aging of skin, reduces risk of acne

###Foods that contain Omega 3 fatty acids
Fish oil, fatty fish, flaxseed, flaxseed oil, soybeans, canola oil, walnuts, chia seeds
(Flaxseeds and flaxseed oil contrain 45-55% of fatty acids as ALA, walnuts contain about 5-10% of fatty acids as ALA).

###Relevant studies
- A study published in June 2021 in the [American Journal of Clinical Nutrtion](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/114/4/1447/6301120) tracked 2240 people over 11 years and omega-3 levels in the blood checked. It was found that nonsmokers with high omega-3 blood levels had highest survival estimate. Researchers concluded that those over the age of 65 years with higher omega-3 blood levels had a lower mortality rate.

- A meta-analysis of 41 studies published in the [British Medical Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2213) published on October 14, 2021 found that those with diets with higher levels of ALA had associations with overall lower mortality risk.
