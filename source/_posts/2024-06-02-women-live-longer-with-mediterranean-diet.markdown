Per *Sandee LaMotte,* in [CNN.com](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/mediterranean-diet-women-early-death-risk-wellness/index.html) *"Mediterranean diet helps women live much longer, a large new study finds".*

>
"Women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet lived much longer than those who did not, according to a new study that followed more than 25,000 women for 25 years.
>
In the new study, published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open, researchers asked 25,315 healthy women participating in the Womenâ€™s Health Study about their diet and collected blood and other biomarkers between 1993 and 1996. Those women were reevaluated between 2018 and 2023.
>
Not only did closely following the Mediterranean diet cut the risk of early death by 23%, it lessened the risk of dying from cancer by 17% and dying from cardiovascular disease by 20%, the study found."

The [Mediterranean diet](https://geridoc.net/blog/2023/06/18/mediterranean-diet-explained/) has been shown to be beneficial in study after study. This particular large-scale [observational study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819335?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=053124) shows the impact embracing a Meditteranean diet can have to the life of a woman and prevention of chronic illnesses. It may just be worth looking at how to incorporate the Meditteranean style of eating by looking at ways to add more fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole wheat, and extra virgin olive oil to our everyday meals.
