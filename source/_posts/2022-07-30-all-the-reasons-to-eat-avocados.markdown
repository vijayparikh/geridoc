Over the years avocado consumption has increased in the world.  July 31st is National Avocado Day and is a good time to reiterate all the health benefits this fruit offers.

- Source of vitamins B, C, E, K, folate
- Has Omega 3 fatty acids so can help fight against Alzheimer's
- Targets insulin resistance with heart-healthy fats
- Has high oleic acid content which is a moisturizing fatty acid-helps keep skin soft and hydrated
- Has potassium to keep blood pressure low
- Contain the most protein and fiber of any fruit. Fiber is good for gut health.
- Although high in calorie(about 300 calories in a 7-ounce avocado), they are packed with nutrients and make you feel full to help maintain healthy body weight

There was a recent [study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024014) released where researchers followed avocado intake of around 110,000 people over a 20-year period that showed promising health benefits of avocados.

- Those that ate 2 or more servings(1 serving equaled about 1 cup) of avocado each weak had a 16% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and 21% lower risk of coronary heart disease compared to those who rarely or never ate avocados.

- Replacing half a serving of daily butter, cheese, eggs, margarine, yogurt, or processed meats with avocado was associated with a 16-22% lower risk of cardiovascular disease

So, lots of reasons to have avocados, put them in burgers, make guac, add them to salads, enjoy avocado toasts, dump them in your tacos and burritos, etc...Get creative, it just may reduce your risk for heart disease.
