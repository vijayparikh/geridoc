NVIDIA is partnering up with the healthcare startup Hippocratic AI to develop AI-powered “agents” for the healthcare arena. These AI nurses are intended to provide basic medical advice for $9 per hour which is less than the average pay of about $40 per hour for a "human" nurse.  Everyone is different with unique healthcare needs so I cannort see this replacing nurses but may be a back up or extra layer for simple things like providing education to patients. As the healthcare worker shortage continues to loom, it will be interesting to see what the future holds and what role these AI healthcare agents take on.
