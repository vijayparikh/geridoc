Getting that good night's sleep is so very important, if can affect you and all your activities and interactions the next day. It is recommended that we get about 7 to 9 hours of good quality sleep a night but it may not always be an easy feat. Here are some tips to ensure a better night's sleep.

###Keep it cool
- it is easier to fall asleep if your bedroom is cooler than warmer
- set your bedroom temperature to about 67Â°F,  the brain and body need to drop a core temperature of about 1 degree Celcius or 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit for you to fall asleep and stay asleep

###Set a regular time to sleep at night for the weekdays and weekends
- you may like to stay up later on weekends and sleep in but your internal body clock and brain responds best when you keep it regular
- this helps with sleep quantity and quality.

###Identify and implement a bedtime routine or wind-down routine that works for you
- examples include shower, stretching, meditation, reading a book, journaling

###Adjust the light
- we need darkness at night to trigger melatonin so we need to be mindful about the last 30 to 60 minutes before bed
- stay away from screens(laptops, phones) about the last hour before sleep, or dim the screens

- use black out curtains in bedroom to avoid excessive light
- in the morning, we should have the most exposure to indoor and outdoor light as we need brightness during morning hours to keep circadian rhythm regular

###Room atmosphere 
- On top of a quiet, dark, and relaxing room atmosphere, where you sleep and what you sleep in matters
- comfortable pajamas and bedding can make a big difference
- invest in a comfortable mattress for you
- work on a pleasant bedroom environment(furniture, acessories,etc) where you feel safe and at ease

###Get recommended exercise
- physical activity during the daytime helps you fall asleep easier but no intense activity 2 hours before sleep

###Things to avoid
- stay away from caffeine at least 6 hours before going to bed
- avoid large meals, spicy food, and alcohol hours before bedtime
- it is best to not eat anything 3 hours before bedtime
- avoid drinking lots of fluids before bedtime, getting up to use the bathroom at night will interrupt your [sleep cycle](http://geridoc.net/blog/2022/12/18/sleep-explained/), especially the later stages
- avoid loud noise
- limit bed to sleep
- be cautious with sleeping pills, sedatives hypnotics do not produce naturalistic sleep and can cause issues with learning and memory including forgetfulness

###Consider tracking your sleep
- We all know that everyone is different but it may be worthwhile every once in a while to
track your sleep.
- there are smart rings, smart mattresses, smart watches that can help
- You can see how changes are affecting your sleep such as exercise, eating at a certain time, etc and can make changes to help with better sleep quality and quantitiy.
