Per *Dennis Thompson,* in [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-06-07/lifestyle-changes-may-slow-or-prevent-alzheimers-in-people-at-high-risk) *"Lifestyle Changes May Slow or Prevent Alzheimer's in People at High Risk".*

"New research shows that a set of healthy lifestyle habits can help preserve brain function in folks with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.
>
About 71% of patients who ate healthy, exercised regularly and engaged in stress management had their dementia symptoms either remain stable or improve without the use of any drugs, researchers reported June 7 in the journal Alzheimer’s Research and Therapy.
>
By comparison, about 68% of patients in a control group without these lifestyle changes experienced a worsening of their symptoms, results show.
>
Researchers also found that the more patients changed their lives in healthy ways and stuck to those changes, the greater the benefit for their brain power.
>
For the study, researchers recruited 51 people with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. They were randomly assigned to either the lifestyle change group or a control group.
>
The people in the lifestyle change group participated in an intensive program with four components:
>
- A whole-foods, plant-based diet low in harmful fats, refined carbs, alcohol and sweeteners.
- Moderate aerobic exercise and strength training at least a half-hour each day.
- Stress management, including meditation, stretching, breathing and guided imagery, for one hour a day.
- Support groups for patients and their partners for one hour three times a week.
>
Results after 20 weeks showed significant differences in the lifestyle group versus the control group, both in brain function and in blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s like the protein amyloid."

Although this was a [study](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01482-z) with a small group, the results are hopeful and positive results were seen in just 20 weeks. These same changes may have a role in the prevention of cognitive impairment... so a little more reason to eat well, exercise, and stress less.
