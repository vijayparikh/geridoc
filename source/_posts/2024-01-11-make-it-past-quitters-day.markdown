Most of our [new year resolutions](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/12/26/some-healthy-new-years-goals/) are over-ambitious. And then LIFE happens.

in 2019, Strava, a social network for athletes, discovered that 80% of resolution-makers give up on their [new year resolutions](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/12/26/some-healthy-new-years-goals/) on the second Friday of January, a day known as "Quitters day".

###So, how to prevent falling off the wagon?
- Don't give up
- Revisit your goals-sometimes we make too many and over do it. Prioritize what is important.
- Revise your resolutions-for example, if the plan was a work out for an hour a day, decrease it to 30 minutes a day
- Work on making small consistent changes instead of a big change
- Accept support from friends and family to stay focused on your goals
- Celebrate your small achievements to stay motivated
- Acknowledge your slip-ups-if you skip a work out or eat an unhealthy meal, acknowledge it and work on doing better in the future


Remember that your [new year resolutions](https://geridoc.net/blog/2021/12/26/some-healthy-new-years-goals/) are not just for January but for the whole year. Work on making small changes to build better habits for the long run.
