###*“To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.” – Oscar Wilde*

August is National Wellness Month reminding us to prioritize our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellness. Self-care and wellness go hand in hand as achieving that equilibrium of wellness requires taking care of yourself. Self-care is a general term and means different things to different people but overall is a way to feel good about yourself, find inner peace, and at the same time, reduce stress. The list of things that you can do for self-care is vast, but here are some things that can be done to achieve that wellness goal.

##Activity
- Walk, hike, jog, yoga, aerobics class
- Get some fresh air, you can even get in a nice sunrise or sunset
- Consider getting a [fitness tracker to motivate you](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/07/06/should-i-get-an-activity-tracker/)

##Eat healthy
- Incorporate those colorful fruit and vegetables in your diet
- Cut down on sugar intake

##Drink plenty of water

##Relaxation
- Treat yourself to the spa
- Spend time with family and friends either in person, call, or video chat
- Meditate, practice deep breathing
- Slow down and literally smell the roses
- Candles, soothing music
- Read

##Sleep
- Don’t skimp on the sleep, your body needs the rest to recharge

At the end of the day, self-care translates to self-love. And we could all use more of that.
