Per [study](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00461?utm_medium=press&utm_source=mediaadvisory&utm_campaign=december2021issue&utm_content=whaley) published in Health Affairs December 2021:

>*"data from 80,342 full-time US physicians to estimate career differences in income between men and women..... Over the course of a simulated forty-year career, male physicians earned an average adjusted gross income of $8,307,327 compared with an average of $6,263,446 for female physiciansâ€”an absolute adjusted difference of $2,043,881 and relative difference of 24.6 percent. Gender differences in career earnings were largest for surgical specialists ($2.5 million difference), followed by nonsurgical specialists ($1.6 million difference) and primary care physicians ($0.9 million difference). These findings imply that over the course of a career, female US physicians were estimated to earn, on average, more than $2 million less than male US physicians after adjustment for factors that may otherwise explain observed differences in income, such as hours worked, clinical revenue, practice type, and specialty"*

The researchers looked at self-reported salary data and found that from the first day of the job to the end of a 40 year career, female physicians made less money for the same job. This is a group of highly educated women who are as capable as their male counterparts. They have spent the same amount of money to get through medical school and also put in the same amount of time in vigourous medical training before practicing medicine.
The gender pay gap across most industries is narrowing, unfortunately the same can not be said about the health care industry.
