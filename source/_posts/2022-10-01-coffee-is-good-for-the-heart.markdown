International Coffee day is celebrated October 1st and a new study was just published in [European Journal of Preventive Cardiology](https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwac189/6704995) that backs up that coffee is actually good for the heart.

In the study, about 450,000 adults from UK Biobank were followed for a period of 12.5 years and results showed that all types of coffee intake were associated with reduction in death from any cause. Drinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest benefit.

In this large prospective cohort study, associations between habitual coffee intake, impact of all coffee subtypes, including decaffeinated coffee, and major cardiovascular endpoints were studied. The main findings from the study are:
>
- Ground, instant, and decaffeinated coffee were associated with equivalent reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
- Two to three cups/day of all coffee subtypes was consistently associated with the largest risk reduction of heart diseasse and all-cause mortality.
- Ground and instant coffee but not decaffeinated were associated with a reduction in heart rhythm abnormalities.

So, it turns out coffee is actually good for you.  Among other countless [benefits of coffee](http://geridoc.net/blog/2021/07/16/is-coffee-good-for-me/), drinking two to three cups of coffee, caffeinated or decaffeinated, will improve longevity and heart disease.  So grab that cup of coffee...or two....or three....and enjoy!
