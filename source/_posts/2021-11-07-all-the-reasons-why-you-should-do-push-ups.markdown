You may often hear of people talking of taking part in numerous activities (swimming, jogging, tennis, aerobics, yoga, etc), but not many people rave about doing push-ups on a regular basis.  Push-ups are often an overlooked exercise, but something definitely worth considering.

There was a study published in [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2724778) in 2019 that should make everybody want to incorporate this into their workout mojo.
This decade long study of male firefighters aged 18 and above found that those that could do more than 40 push-ups had a significant decrease in cardiovascular disease compared to those who could do 10 or fewer push-ups.
