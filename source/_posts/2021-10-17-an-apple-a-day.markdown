We’ve all heard  “an apple a day keeps the doctor away". This proverb initially appeared in the 19th century to get people to eat nutritious foods to stay healthy.

National Apple day, October 21st, gives us the opportunity to review the health benefits of apples.

- Helps to maintain weight or even lose weight-makes you feel full,  on average apple is about 95 calories
- Contains antioxidants
- [Heart healthy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29086478/)-contains flavonoids which reduces inflammation
- Helps in digestion as it contains fiber
- Helps prevent Type 2 Diabetes-soluble fiber can help slow the absorption of sugar
- Helps with memory and [may prevent Alzheimer’s disease](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/112/2/343/5823790) because it contains plant pigment quercetin, a flavonoid which protects cells including brain cells
- Promotes bone density and strength
- Keep the peel on if you can-it contains fiber and  antioxidants
- Helps your immunity-contains about 10–14% of the Vitamin C you need, also has the flavonoid [quercetin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27187333/) which reduces inflammation and regulates the immune system, helps with asthma and allergic reactions


Apples are healthiest when you eat them fresh but get creative if you need. Try out all those apple recipes, be it apple pie, apple crisp, apple sauce….or grab another fruit! Remember that the whole point is to get those nutrients, whatever fruit it may be, so you can reap those health benefits.
