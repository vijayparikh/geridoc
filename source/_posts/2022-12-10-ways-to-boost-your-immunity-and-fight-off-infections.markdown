It's the season of viruses...we have a "tripledemic" going on with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19 surging throughout the country.  Hospitals are getting overwhelmed while staffing shortage continues and cold medications are becoming harder to find on shelves. We all have to do our parts to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.

###Steps to avoid infection
- Get vaccinated-take flu and covid-19 vaccines
- Keep up with hand hygiene
- Wipe down counters/phones/keys with sanitation wipes(viruses can live on surfaces)
- If someone is infected with a virus, stay away from others, especially young children and elderly(it is spread via respiratory droplets(coughing, sneezing, etc.). Don't shy away from wearing that mask.

###Boost immunity
- Exercise regularly
- Get your beauty sleep-don't skimp on sleep(adults should be getting about 7 to 9 hours a sleep each night)
- Maintain healthy weight
- Try to minimize stress
- Eat lots of fruits and vegetables

###Foods that help with immunity
Of course, drinking plenty of water and getting those [antioxidants](http://geridoc.net/blog/2022/12/01/antioxidants-and-oxidative-stress/) in you is important. Here are some examples of foods you should be eating to up your natural immunity.
