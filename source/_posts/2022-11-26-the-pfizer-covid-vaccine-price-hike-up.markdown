Per Annalisa Merilli published October 22, 2022 in [Quartz](https://qz.com/pfizer-plans-to-sell-its-covid-vaccine-at-a-10-000-mar-1849688359):

>*"For over two years now, the US government has purchased all of the covid vaccines administered in the country, in what has become the largest public vaccination campaign in American history. Those purchases have included more than 500 million doses from Pfizer. The first 100 million cost around $20 a dose, thanks to an earlier agreement in which the US government invested $1.95 billion in vaccine production. The remaining doses were bought for around $30 each. But once the US government supplies run out (likely in the first quarter of 2023) and covid vaccines and therapeutics are moved onto commercial health platforms, Pfizer is able to hike up the price of its shots. The company announced on Oct. 20 that it intends to sell the covid vaccine, marketed under the brand name Comirnaty, for $110 to $130 per dose. This is about four times the current selling price—and 100 times the estimated cost of manufacturing the vaccine. According to The People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of over 100 organizations working to end vaccine inequity, Pfizer spends less than $1.20 to produce each dose of vaccine"*

A 10,000% price hike of the COVID vaccine which has the power to save lives is hard to digest. Pfizer can talk about packaging and distributing costs but really cannot justify a mark up like this. The flu shot costs about $18 to $28, and the COVID vaccine cost will be about $110 to $130. It just goes to show, nothing changes, not even after a pandemic, the number one priority of pharmaceutical companies will be to make money and pad their bonuses.
